Hi I'm Zunnoon! 

I'm a recent UNSW Sydney graduate of Computer Science and Commerce.

I post all my personal projects on my GitHub to show my passion for Software Engineering and programming as a whole.

I also love drawing pixel art, so take a look at some of my projects, which often use pixel animations!
